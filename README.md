# SkDisaster

A generic addon that aims to add random features other addons might not have such as:
> Map support<br>
> Reactive variables<br>
> Image reading support (file and URL)<br>
> Java code compiling from string<br>
> Reading of files<br>
> Have any more feature ideas? Feel free to post them on [discord](https://discord.gg/9kV7AuyFte) and they __might__ be added<br>
