# SkDisaster

A generic addon that aims to add random features other addons might not have such as:
> Map support 
> Reactive variables
> Image reading support (file and URL)
> Java code compiling from string
> Reading of files
> Have any more feature ideas? Feel free to post them on discord and they __might__ be added
